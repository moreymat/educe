## About

Educe is a library for working with discourse-annotated corpora.
It also includes some utility scripts for building, maintaining,
and for querying these corpora. Currently supported corpora are

* (SDRT) [STAC][stac] corpus
* (RST) RST Discourse Treebank (experimental, 2014-07-14)
* (PDTB) Penn Discourse Treebank (experimental, 2014-07-14)

If you have a discourse-annotated corpus, or are trying to build one,
you may find it useful to add support for it to educe.

## Using educe
